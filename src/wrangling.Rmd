```

# WIDGET 2 STUFF

# to create a histogram of counts of prey obtained we would just need the prey item, success of dive (which indicates if dive is brought to surface or not), and prey quantity to determine the number of prey successfully caught 
prey <- otters %>% 
  select(suc, prey_item, date, age, prey_qty) %>% 
  group_by(prey_item) %>%

# example plot with all a couple prey shown: widget selection would be CLA, SAG, UNK
top_prey <- prey %>% 
  filter(prey_item == "CLA" |
           prey_item == "SAG" |
