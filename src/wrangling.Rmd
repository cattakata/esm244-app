```{r}
# reading in data + some cleaning up
otters <- read.csv(here("data", "2018_Foraging.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>% 
  rename(aerial_survey_yr = year) # i know you probably hate this name LOL but i only renamed it because this is a DIFFERENT THING than the date; i was getting confused as to why the date and year columns had diff years listed so i just want to make that clear
